        <h2>Engineering Diversity Interview Questions</h2>
        <p>As part of our initiative to highlight the voices of underrepresented groups in engineering, we ask each participant the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What inspired you to pursue a career in engineering, and how has your background influenced your journey?</li>
            <li>Can you share a significant challenge you've encountered as an underrepresented individual in engineering and how you addressed it?</li>
            <li>What types of support or resources have been most valuable to you in your engineering career, and what do you wish was more readily available?</li>
            <li>How do you think your unique perspective as an underrepresented individual has impacted your work or the field of engineering as a whole?</li>
            <li>What advice would you give to young people from underrepresented groups who are considering a career in engineering?</li>
        </ol>
