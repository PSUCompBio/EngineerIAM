    <h2>Diversity Groups in Engineering</h2>
    <p>Our project aims to highlight the diverse voices within the engineering community, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Women in Engineering</li>
        <li>Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) Engineers</li>
        <li>LGBTQ+ Engineers</li>
        <li>Engineers with Disabilities</li>
        <li>Veteran Engineers</li>
        <li>First-Generation College Graduate Engineers</li>
        <li>Engineers from Low Socioeconomic Backgrounds</li>
        <li>Older Engineers who entered the field later in life</li>
        <li>Engineers from Underrepresented Geographic Regions</li>
        <li>Engineers practicing in fields with significant gender imbalances</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our goal is to bring forth the unique perspectives and experiences of these groups to foster a more inclusive and diverse engineering environment.</p>
